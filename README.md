# camels_graphwavenet
Code repo for graphwavenet using CAMELS

These are most of the files used in my CAMELS ML work (The CAMELS data loaders were too large to be uploaded).

To use for your own work, just implement the data loaders as requested.

- readcamels_log.py, this is the main data preparation file for using CAMELS data
- trainwavenetwu.py, this is the main driver of GraphWaveNet
- util_gtnet.py, contains utility functions
- utils_wnet.py, contains utility functions
