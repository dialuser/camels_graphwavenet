# CAMELS Graphwavenet
Code repo for graphwavenet on CAMELS

These are most of the files used in my CAMELS WRR work (The CAMELS data loaders were too large to be uploaded).

The original WRR paper is 

*Sun, Alexander Y., Peishi Jiang, Maruti K. Mudunuru, and Xingyuan Chen. "Explore Spatio‚ÄêTemporal Learning of Large Sample Hydrology Using Graph Neural Networks." Water Resources Research 57, no. 12 (2021): e2021WR030394.*

The original GraphWaveNet paper is 

*Wu, Z., Pan, S., Long, G., Jiang, J., & Zhang, C. (2019). Graph wavenet for deep spatial-temporal graph modeling. arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.00121.*


To use for your own work, just implement the data loaders as requested.

For lookback = 30 days

- `readcamels.py`, this is the main data preparation file for using CAMELS data
- `trainwavenetwu.py`, this is the main driver of GraphWaveNet
- `gwnetmodel.py`, the original GraphWaveNet model by Wu et al.
- `util_gtnet.py`, contains utility functions
- `utils_wnet.py`, contains utility functions

For lookback = 365 days [note: the datasets for 365 days are significantly larger. I had to switch to HDF format for data loading]

- `readcamels365.py`, this is the main data preparation file for using CAMELS data
- `trainwavenetwu365.py`, this is the main driver of GraphWaveNet

To reproduce my paper experimental results for lookback=30 days, run `runsample`

To generate data for 365 days, run `batchgen_365`

To run 365-day experiment, try `runsample365`
